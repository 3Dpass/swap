# dotACP: Manual testing guide

Want to test and break dotACP? Awesome! Follow the instructions below to manually test this feature.
- The Ledger of Things DEX [swap.3dpscan.io](https://swap.3dpscan.io)

## Install some Polkadot browser extension wallet

To test the staging environment, you'll need to have the Polkadot wallet browser extension installed. We've successfully tested it with three wallet options: polkadot.js, Subwallet, and Talisman. These wallets are fully supported.

## Get tokens

In order to test it out on The Ledger of Things you need some P3D.

## Swap your P3D for TEST tokens

TEST tokens has been issued on The Ledger of Things especially for the testing purposes.

## Create your own tokens to test

You can also create your own tokens and get them listed on trading. Either, you can use these [guidelines](https://3dpass.org/assets#general) to create: 
- conventional [Fungible assets](https://3dpass.org/assets#conventional-fungible-assets)
- or get your object tokenized with 3DPRC-2 standard and mint its [share-tokens](https://3dpass.org/assets#3dprc2-fungible) (you've got two options: getting your object tokenized into either fungible or non-fungible asset).

## Create Liquidity Pool and test your own tokens swap 

Use the [swap.3dpscan.io](https://swap.3dpscan.io) UI to add a liquidity pool with your tokens. 

Test it out, play around, and get back to us with comments! ðŸš€
